# front-end

You will create an interactive web page (again using HTML, CSS and Javascript and submitted as a .Zip file) that expands upon your world building exercise to create a story. We will go beyond world-building to create a character based narrative set in your imagined future. We will zoom in to a specific time and place. It will incorporate key ideas, themes, settings and technologies from your previous assignment. Think of your story as a path through your world that brings it to life through specific experiences narratives. Your interactive story will be an artwork that makes us think more deeply about digital media technologies of the present and future.

We will be thinking of the browser as a medium for presenting the viewer with content in a particular sequence, as determined by you and the viewer. You are encouraged to be bold and experimental in your approach to narrative - what can a story be! How can you stretch the form to make it new and interesting.

It must contain, in any order or form:

- Video -This can be live action, animation, AI generated, or made with any other tool of your choosing (stock or appropriated footage can only be used subject to approval.

- Text - your final script should be around 800-1000 words (this may vary depending on the format and style of your story).

- At least 1 character, this could be your narrator if you wish.

- Audio - There must be music, dialogue and/or atmos/sound fx to accompany your story. You can use voice clones to create your dialogue if you wish.

- At least 3 interactive elements (this can include your main navigation system, image rollovers, text popups, css/javascript animations and transitions - the sky is the limit depending on how far you want to go with Javascript and/or other interactive systems).

- It should take around 10 minutes to experience/absorb your piece (this is negotiable depending on your idea).

- Note that although we are not making our sites live (you may do that on your own if you wish) your files must be optimised for the web i.e as small as possible. Images and video must be compressed in suitable formats, audio should be mp3.

To get you thinking - your story might take the form of:

- A promotion for a product/service/app/corporation/platform of the future that incorporates user/proprietor testimony. An ethically questionable mental health service perhaps?

- A news report outlining a technologically induced disaster such as a server crash, data breach or malfunction that includes testimony from those affected.

- The story of a political revolution told in the form of an online discussion thread embellished with accompanying media.

- An experimental narrative exploring the philosophy of technology consisting of appropriated footage from a video game.

These are just some example ideas - use your imagination!

Ask Yourself:

(these are not to be used as headings, theyâ€™re prompts for your thinking)

How will the journey undertaken by your character/s help viewers understand your future world, and through it, our own? What balance of these different forms of media does your world/story require? What do you want your viewers to feel, think and consider when viewing your story? What message do you want your viewers to receive? Is ecological ruin a feature of your imagined world, and if so, what might emerge in its wake? What is the most elegant way to code and structure your interactive narrative?



Notes on the format:

Although we are working with an experimental format, there are numerous examples of interactive browser based story telling for you to take inspiration from. Some of those we will be looking at in class include this site by the Canadian film board, and this experimental film by German collective Total Refusal.

Remember that you are limited only by your imagination and your skills!
